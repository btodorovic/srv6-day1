# Day One: Introduction to SRv6

This is the repo of the VMM Lab topology from the Juniper Networks Day One book on SRv6 - [Day One: Introduction to SRv6](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/day-one-books/DayOne-Intro-SRv6.pdf).
A copy of that book, along with some useful slide decks, is available in the [docs](docs/) directory.

Some very nice PCAP files, collected during playing with this topology, which can be analyzed using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), are stored in the [pcap](pcap/) directory.
